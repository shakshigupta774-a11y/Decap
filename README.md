# Decap — AI-powered misinformation defender

**Decap** is a prototype app built for the GenAI Exchange Hackathon.  
It helps users instantly verify suspicious forwards and links, while also teaching them how to spot misinformation through micro-lessons in meme or tip format.  

---

## 🔍 Problem
Every day, millions of Indians receive messages and forwards through WhatsApp, SMS, and social media.  
But not all of them are true. Fake news spreads faster than facts, leading to health risks, financial loss, and social unrest.  
Most people don’t have a quick way to check if what they’re reading is trustworthy.

---

## 💡 Solution
**Decap** is designed to:
- Let users **verify suspicious text or links instantly**  
- Show a **verdict**: ✅ True / ❌ Fake / ⚠️ Misleading  
- Display a **confidence score** and **credible references**  
- Provide **micro-lessons in meme style** so users learn how to spot misinformation in the future

## 🧪 Sample Demo Posts
Here are 5 misinformation examples tested in our demo:

1. **Fake job link**  
   _“Government is giving free job forms — apply here [randomlink.com]”_ → ❌ Fake  

2. **Health misinformation**  
   _“Eating bananas after 6 PM causes instant heart attack! NASA study proves this kills 90% of people. My doctor uncle confirmed this. Please share to save lives! 🍌💀”_ → ❌ Fake (source: WHO fact-check)  

3. **rumor**  
   _“WhatsApp will be charged from tomorrow! Rs. 25 per month. To keep it free forever, forward this message to 15 contacts including me. This message has special code that registers you for lifetime free service. Don't ignore! ⚡”_ → ⚠️ Misleading
